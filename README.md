# tibia
My own project for tibia with over 4 years of on and off work. Reuploaded several times due to rookie mistakes so the git log is messed up. For personal use only.


This is the 1998 MMORPG Tibia, balanced for single player play. 
Completely rebalances all 4 classes, redid a lot of damage formulae and experience gain formulae.
Melee weapons are updated to be more interesting (ranged melee weapons, aoe weapons, more elemental variety).
Distance weapons have more range to account for ranged melee weapons.
Magic is rebalanced to do more damage at the cost of higher mana costs.

All enemies have been modified to make elemental strengths and weaknesses more relevant.
HP has been increased across the board to combat mechanics powercreep (it's still way easier than vanilla Tibia).
Potions are greatly powered up, but shop prices for potions are increased x100 so it's no longer viable to buy potions.
And tons of other changes.
